#Mood Logger

The idea behind this rails application is to build a CRUD mood-logger. It accepts user account creation and users can then create

The way this project works is that it will be a simple list of options to choose from:
Feeling - Good, okay, bad
Food Feeling (how well you ate?) - Good, okay, bad
Physical Feeling (sick, etc?) - Good, okay, bad
